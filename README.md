# Submarine Cables

Submarine cables are robust, armored cables laid on the ocean floor, primarily using optical fibers to transmit vast amounts of data as light pulses, forming the physical backbone of the global internet and international communications. These cables connect continents and countries, offering much higher capacity and lower latency than satellites for activities like emails, streaming, and online services.

# Internet Traffic

Submarine cables, primarily owned by private telecom and tech companies, form the physical backbone of the internet, carrying over 99% of all intercontinental data traffic. The data physically travels as pulses of light through thin glass threads that lie on the ocean floor.

**Working:**

1.Data Transmission as Light

2.Optical Fibers

3.Signal Amplification

4.Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)

5.Cable Landing Stations

# Physical Infrastructure

**1.Physical Route:** Specialized ships are used to lay the cables along carefully surveyed routes that avoid natural hazards like volcanic activity, earthquake fault zones, and sensitive marine habitats. In deep water, the cables simply rest on the seabed, while in shallower areas near shores, they are typically buried under the seabed for protection against fishing activity and ship anchors.

**2.Durability:** The cables themselves are robust, consisting of multiple layers of insulation, steel wiring for strength, and a protective outer jacket to withstand the harsh deep-sea environment and external pressures.
